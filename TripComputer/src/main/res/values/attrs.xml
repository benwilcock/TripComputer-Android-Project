Uses drawable/card_background_day.xml or drawable/card_background_night.xml depending on the NIGHT_MODE setting.
Had to use a hack to get the background technique to work with different themes. This is possibly because the SOLID shapes used
by the UI as card backgrounds seem to be immutable and won't allow the use of attrs.xml based definitions for their colour.
Workaround is to use 2 files (day/night) with fixed colours, but get the Style for the Layout to use a STRING attribute
for the background name which can be switched at runtime.
